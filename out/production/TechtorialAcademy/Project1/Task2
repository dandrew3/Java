Difference between JRE, JDK, JVM
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment which we usually download as a Java software. The JRE
consists of the Java Virtual Machine, Java platform classes, and supporting libraries. The JRE is the
runtime component of Java software and is all we need to run any Java application.

JDK stands for Java Development Kit is a superset of the JRE and includes everything that the JRE contains.
Additionally, it comes with the compilers and debuggers tools required for developing Java applications.

JVM stands for Java Virtual machine. It translates and executes the Java bytecode. It's the entity
which transforms Java to become a "portable language" (i.e. write once, run anywhere). Java compiler
generates bytecode for all the Java code and converts into class files.
